20 1920 6""/53 guns for secondary battery.
8 3""/50 AA mounts.

Intended to outrun and outrange HMS Hood with similar armor protection. Can penetrate HMS Nelson from a range that renders Nelson's fire ineffective per very rough navweaps calculations. 

Turbo-Electric drive allows for more effecient distribution of machinery. 

5 Shafts required to handle required power, 4 turbines with generators to feed the drive motors.
